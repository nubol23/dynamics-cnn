This repo contains source code for the paper `DYNAMIC BEHEAVIOUR DETERMINATION BASED ON ATTRACTOR IMAGES AND THE USE OFDEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS`



## Instructions

In order to replicate results

* Run `chua.py` to generate images of chua circuits, use parameter `--n_images` like

  ```bash
  python chua.py --n_images 5
  ```

  to generate `n` images for each attractor with different perspectives

* Run `generate_partitions` to create train, validation and test partitions
